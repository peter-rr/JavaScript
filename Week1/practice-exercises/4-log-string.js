// 1. Declare a variable myString and assign a string to it. Use your full name, including spaces, as the content for the string.
var myString = "Peter Funk";

// 2. Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.
console.log("I think the value of the string is the full name I've just assigned to it");

// 3. Now console.log the variable myString.
console.log(myString);

// 4. Now reassign to the variable myString a new string.
myString = "Tony Allen & Jeff Mills"

// 5. Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.
console.log("I think the value of the string is the new full name I've reassigned to it");

// 6. Now console.log myString again.
console.log(myString);
